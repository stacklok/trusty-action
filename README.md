# Trusty Dependency Risk Action

### Check the quality and safety of dependencies in pull requests

[Stacklok Insight](https://insight.stacklok.com/) is a free-to-use service that
helps developers assess dependency risk. Stacklok Insight uses statistical
analysis of dimensions such as author and repo activity, along with a packageâ€™s
source of origin, to provide an assessment about its trustworthiness.

This action integrates Stacklok Insight into your GitHub workflow, allowing you
to automatically check the quality and safety of your dependencies on every pull
request.

The Stacklok Insight service used by this action analyzes thousands of packages
a day across multiple languages to provide a security and quality analysis of
dependencies. Dependencies are run through a series of static analysis, machine
learning, and malware detection checks to identify potential security risks or
quality issues.

## Overview

This action takes any added dependencies within a pull request and assesses
their relative risk using the [Stacklok Insight](https://insight.stacklok.com/)
API. If any dependencies are found to be below a certain threshold (see details
below), the action will fail.

If any dependencies are malicious, deprecated, or archived, the action will also
fail.

Language support:

- Python
- JavaScript
- Java
- Rust
- Go

## Features

Check if dependencies are malicious, deprecated or archived

![Malicious Package](docs/malicious.png)

Check if dependencies are deprecated or archived (and get alternative
recommendations)

![Archived Package](docs/archived.png)

Check if dependencies have a
[proven source of origin provenance map](https://docs.stacklok.com/insight/understand/provenance)
(using sigstore or Git Tag / Release mapping)

![Provenance Package](docs/prov.png)

Assess the author and repository activity and security risks of dependencies

## Inputs

Only one input is available for this action:

`global_threshold`: The minimum score required for a dependency to be considered
high quality. Anything below this score will fail the action.

`repo_activity_threshold`: The minimum score required for a repo to be
considered actively maintained. Anything below this score will fail the action.

`author_activity_threshold`: The minimum score required for an author to be
considered actively maintaining their packages. Anything below this score will
fail the action.

`provenance_threshold`: The minimum score required for a package to have a
proven source of origin. Anything below this score will fail the action.

`typosquatting_threshold`: The minimum score required for a package to be
considered not typosquatting. Anything below this score will fail the action.

`fail_on_malicious`: Whether to fail the action if a package is malicious.
Default is `true`.

`fail_on_deprecated`: Whether to fail the action if a package is deprecated.
Default is `true`.
